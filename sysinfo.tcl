#
# This script shows the system information of the bot's machine.
# How much or how little of what the script shows can be changed by 
# editing the sysinfo281.06.pl perl script included within.
# If your IRC network limits the character output and you're getting
# an incomplete output, remove some of the output options in the included
# perl file under:
# "These are the default settings for which information gets displayed."
#
# Thanks to David Rudie who's perl script does 99% of the work.
# Thanks also to imbezol for some modifications to the perl script and some help with tcl.
# The perl and bash scripts must both be chmodded executable for it to work, if they aren't 
# already.
#
# Current MSG Commands:
#    !sysinfo [option]
#
# Current Channel Commands:
#    !sysinfo [option]
#
# Currently the only option is -p which will send sysinfo in a private message
